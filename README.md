# Electric-site

actual site in the negev that is dedicated to producing electrical power-flow 
using most ×§ffective technolegies that harness the sun to produce electrical power.
- solar panels
- CSPonD molten salt receiver/storage system
- Solar thermal generators

Talk to:
Alexander Slocum of mechanical engineering is working with teams of collaborators from MIT and the Masdar Institute to begin pilot-scale tests of a simple, inexpensive system in which a tankful of molten salt absorbs the heat of the sun, stores it, and delivers it for power generation at any time of the day or night.
